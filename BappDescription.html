<p>TypeXplorer is a Burp Suite extension designed to test different content types in HTTP requests. It allows users to test all possible Content-Types (such as urlencoded, JSON, XML) and visually review the responses in a user-friendly interface. This tool is particularly useful for finding vulnerabilities that involve certain restrictions, like CSRF, IDOR, and ATO. Changing the Content-Type header manually might be a tedious task, but with this extension, all checks can be performed in a single click.</p>
